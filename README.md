# algorithm
Useful algorithms

1) k-means.cs - implementation of K-MEANS clustering algorithm
2) neural_network.cs - consists a few algorithm for machine learning sush as: 
perceptron, back-propagation/feed-forward and functions for normalization input data(min-max and gauss)
3) algorithm.java - with simple algorithm
4) xor.cpp - xor-method
5) sort.cpp - couple of sort algorithm
6) baseline-predictors.cpp - algorithm for prediction based on mean and variation
7) matrix.cpp - class matrix
